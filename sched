ANSO 295Y This course explores the relationship between society and the environment from the sub-discipline of environmental sociology. The course analyzes the development of environmental sociology, the historical domination of nature in western society, and the existing sociological approaches analyzing the environment-society relationship particularly as they relate to
the contradictions of capitalism, consumerism, and economic development. This course will begin with an overview of the field and then focus on several advanced topics, such as social
construction of nature, risk society, environmental inequalities, social dimensions of environmental problems (global climate change, resource depletion, pollution, etc), and strategies for
environmental adaptation and sustainability. Prereq: ANSO 103 Contemporary Social Issues or ENVS 101 Introduction to Environmental Studies. Students who have successfully completed

CLAS 273I Greek and Roman sexual attitudes and behaviors have engendered highly charged debates in the modern world around issues of intimacy, privacy, and the proper relationship
between the individual and the state. This course explores Greek and Roman concepts of gender, love, and sexuality as documented in ancient literary texts and works of visual art. Topics
will include Greek pederasty, the symposium, ancient prostitution, and the regulation of sexual desires and behaviors. We will conclude by discussing some modern works that respond to
ancient attitudes toward sexuality, e.g. Oscar Wilde, A.E. Housman, and John Cameron Mitchell. HUM; W; DV.

HIST 267E This course seeks to recover the shifting history of what gender and sexual identity have meant in American history to the present day. Personal choice, cultural possibility, and
the operations of the state have all come together to shape the ways in which people experienced sex and attraction (or didn't), and understood masculinity, femininity, and non-binary identities over time. Through readings, short stories, oral histories, illustrations, and photographs we'll engage with this history in search of a more complex understanding of present-day debates
around these issues.

PHIL 142 What is it to lead a good life? In this class, we will explore four traditional philosophical approaches to this question. These may include Buddhism, Confucianism, Skepticism,
Stoicism, and Taoism. We will first read about and discuss these approaches. Students will then choose one of them to "live out" for a few days, incorporating its insights into their lives and
seeing whether they bear any fruit, and then reporting back to the class with their observations and experiences. During this period, we will also consider different theories about what
makes life meaningful and about the value of philosophy.

ANSO 295Z We tend to think of scientists, doctors, and engineers as occupying relatively apolitical positions. While debates over government funding priorities or diversity in the laboratory
occasionally pop up, we usually imagine scientists at the lab bench, striving to discover objective truths; doctors discovering cures for ailments; and engineers seeking new solutions to
technical problems. By contrast, this course begins from the premise that science, technology, and medicine are inherently political acts. That is, they are both a product of social conditions
and, in turn, affecting our collective ways of life. In calling science, medicine, and technology political acts, we do not seek to dismiss their forms of practice (nor their claims to objectivity).
Rather we will strive to understand how the existence of these expert communities affects and is affected by democratic politics. Prereq: ANSO 102 or 103 or permission of instructor.

Anna Akhmatova (Russia). The poetry of these authors, while remarkably lyrical, sensuous, and moving, is also profoundly metaphysical in its exploration of questions related to our improbable and fragile existence as creatures of the cosmos. (All readings for this course will be in English translations.) Prerequisite: one course in literature (any language), creative writing, art,
photography, theater, philosophy, religious studies, or permission of the instructor.

ENG 245 Through reading historical and contemporary literature, this course will explore how the experience of health, illness, and medicine is shaped by language into multiple acts of storytelling. We’ll be challenged in our understanding of patients and doctors, power and weakness, health and illness, body and mind. We’ll read accounts of how different cultures imagine
health and healing. And we’ll investigate and imagine, through metaphor and fact, the meaning of embodied experience. This course is designed for students in literary studies and other
Humanities disciplines, students in Health Studies or interested in health care, and any student who wants to be challenged to think about the humans at the heart of medicine. Meets

ENG 380FF Jane Austen has fascinated both audiences and artists for the past two hundred years. In this course, we will explore Austen's more popular novels and the adaptations they
have inspired. These adaptations--in literature, film, and other contemporary media--extend from Bridget Jones's Diary, to the BBC and Colin Firth, to Lizzie Bennet, to Keira Knightly, to the
graphic novels, and perhaps to zombies. Along with these texts, we will read contemporary theories of adaptation, film, narrative, and narration.

Outside Over There; the aesthetic influences (from Mozart to Blake to Laurel and Hardy) that inform Sendak's narrative art; and Sendak as a cultural force whose modern mythology helped
redefine our notions of childhood and whose pop cultural reach has extended from Broadway to Spike Jonze films to wild thing hoodies. Of special consideration is the figure of the child in
Sendak's work, its origins as well as its monstrous and angelic incarnations.

ENVS 265 Food Justice explores issues of access, equity, and justice in the American food system, with special focus paid to the topics of food insecurity, fisheries access and consolidation, and agricultural work. The course examines the way in which the allocation of resources in the food systems has disprortionately disadvantaged poor, minority, and immigrant communities. The course asks students to assess the implications of such food systems, positioning their analyses within community, environmental, and workers-rights approaches to social justice.
The course's capstione is a community-based research project that identifies structural problems in the food system and devises asset-based solutions to these problems.

HIST 247 This course focuses on one of the most important tools of the historian's trade-oral history. We will play an active part in adding to the historical record by conducting oral history
interviews with people who have impacted or continue to shape their communities. We will ask: how do the documents we use affect the stories we tell about the past? How can we use
oral, visual, and written sources together to offer more satisfying historical explanations? We also will be thinking critically about how knowledge about the past is produced; how popular
culture affects historical memory; and how a focus on different people's experiences might challenge the conclusions we draw about past events and current debates. This is a hands-on
methodology course for students interested in public history or conducting historical research in the twentieth century.

issues, voter constituencies and cultural practices began to weave the country back together. Recognizing the incredibly complex and diverse nature of historical development in this era, our
class time will be spent focusing only on a few of the most significant shifts in American politics, culture, and society that students will help select at the beginning of the semester.
Documentaries, films, and readings will encourage us to think more deeply about the fate of liberalism in post-1960s America, the rise of ethnic identity and its impact on the rights revolu-

MUS 195A Music is a powerful force, amplifying the message of a social movement, but beyond affirmation of political beliefs, what functions can music serve in a movement? Under what
conditions can music affect social change and mobilize political resistance? How can we evaluate the effect of music on a movement community and on its society, state, or nation? Through
global case studies representing both successful and failed social movements through history, this course considers the functions of music in social movements including ideological expression, education, conversion, identity formation, recruitment, mobilizaiton, transformative experience, ritual, fundraising, and internal debate.

RELS 241B Speculative fiction in the various incarnations of science fiction and fantasy wanders perennially in realms traditionally considered the purview of religion, asking questions
about the ordering of the universe, the nature of existence, and the proper basis for human (and non-human) relations. Through careful reading/viewing of novels, short stories, movies and
television episodes, this course will explore the ways science fiction and some fantasy invent systems of meaning that are either explicitly or implicitly religious, both in recasting or adapting
received religious forms, and in imagining new forms of their own.

various individuals and social groups experience their bodies? How do power relations shape our bodily capacities and sense of self? How do groups use bodies to realize their identities?
And how does medicine, violence, and technology shape the human body?

ART 280J Ceramic art has sometimes been marginalized as decorative or craft. More recently, the work of ceramic artists has been the focus of critical attention from the art world at large.
Taught by ceramic artist and Knox Artist in Residence, Kahlil Irving, this course focuses on the expressive/artistic potential of clay. Students will be introduced to the work of current ceramic
artists, many of whom use clay as a vehicle of social/political examination. Through producing a series of start-to-finish works, students will develop skills in slab-construction, slip-casting,
extruding, and coil-building. In addition, students will gain experience in mold-making, clay and glaze formulation and application, kiln-loading and firing techniques. Although the class may be of
special interest to those with some ceramics background, none is required.

the anatomy and physiology of plants, with an emphasis on how plants grow and interact wi plant development using a comparative approach between major
groups of plants. Specific topics will include structures of the plant, photosynthesis, the life cycle of non-vascular, seedless, and flowering plants, regulation of plant growth, and interactions
with the biotic and abiotic environment.

Tribunella has identified as "the child flaneur" in particular. Of special consideration is the child's experience of urban space and how this experience informs creativity, agency, and identity.
Finally, we'll look at a variety and ranges of children's texts, including picture books and YA novels.

ENG 380A This course is an intensive-reading course covering the major part of Woolf's literary output. We consider her formal/experimental development in conjunction with issues informing the writing: political and social engagement and critique, gender and sexuality, the relation of self and other. We aim at a subtle understanding of the intersections of text and context,
and consider these in terms of Woolf's own quest to loosen the boundaries and shake up the convention of literary genre. Inevitably, we examine Woolf's position as "great" female modernist, asking what Woolf means to us as readers in the context of our own debates over culture and gender. Finally, and above all, we consider her concerted development of a style suited
to comprehend and portray the complex workings of the individual psyche in perpetual dialectic with the surrounding influences of society.

GERM 332E The course introduces students to Gender Studies in German literature as well as to leading literary paradigms of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Literary
Gender Studies often concentrates on the representation of gender in literature. This course adds an additional perspective: it also focuses on the gender of literature. Literature is associated with practices and faculties of the mind that carry connotations of masculinity and femininity. The different ways in which literature is gendered not only determine the type of literature
produced, but they also have a decisive influence on the access men and women have to literature as authors and readers. Prerequisites: for GERM 332, GERM 210; for GERM 332E, sophomore standing or permission of the instructor.

PHIL 295T Michel Foucault's work analyzes the functioning of power as a field of releristically, sexuality, policing, punishment, madness, and mental illness, among other things. He is particularly interested to describe the development of these practices in order to make clear how their domains were made available as
objects of scientific discourse and about which truth claims could be made. In this course, we track the development of Foucault's theorizing the power relations that structure social practices and the truth claims that can be made about their domains. We end by considering Foucault's late turn to ethics and the philosophical practices of the ancient world in light of his interest in the complex relatins between power and truth.

RELS 241D From music videos to computer games, advertisements to sporting events, religious imagery permeates popular culture. But popular culture does more than just make use of
religious images. It can take on the trappings of religious practice, fill social desires for transcendent experience, even influence the self-perceptions of religious communities. This course
examines the intersections between popular culture and religion in contemporary America by asking how popular culture may be functioning as religion, how it may shape what a society
understands about religion, and how it may permeate the faith experiences of religion's adherents.

ANSO 295DD The course looks at contemporary representations of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as portrayed in Palestinian and Israeli popular culture. We will explore works of novelists,
journalists, filmmakers and artists, and the meanings they ascribe to such concepts as ôhomeland,ö ôreligious identity,ö ôexile,ö ônation,ö ôstruggle,ö and ôliberation.ö We will study the
analysis media representations offer to moments of politicized violence in the region, and the reception of these analyses in the Palestinian and Israeli public sphere. Finally, we will study
the fields of power related to production of these works: who has the power to write/film, and thus represent, the realities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Which voices are silenced in
these? How can we reconstruct radical voices in their analysis of the events by looking at these different representations of conflict? No prior knowledge of Hebrew or Arabic is required.

ANSO 344 From conflicts over Confederate monuments to battles over school textbooks, from lawsuits seeking monetary reparations for state violence to the proliferation of historical
museums, the question of how to narrate the past is increasingly central to the ways we define our individual and collective identities. In this class, we examine how anthropological theory
and ethnographic practice can contribute to understanding the stakes of historical representation. In so doing, we ask: How do societies remember their past? How should they" What is
at stake in labeling certain narrations of the past as "history" and others as "memory?" And how does the way we describe the past reflect, affect, and transform relations of power in the
present?

ENG 245B "Poetry," Auden famously said, "makes nothing happen." In this multi-genre course, we will engage his claim by exploring texts that cast artists as potential disruptors of power
structures. Under what conditions might art become an act of resistance and to what ends? When and how do the conventions of genre, or language itself, become systems of oppression?
How might writers intervene? We will consider artists and audiences in the fiction of Franz Kafka, James Baldwin, and Don DeLillo; we will grapple with the intricate interrogations of power
and complicity in the nonfiction of James Agee and Eula Biss; and we will study the innovations of poets like Muriel Rukeyser and Layli Long Soldier, among others.

HIST 271G This travel-based course has two goals: to teach students in detail the long history of the city of Jerusalem, and to facilitate first-hand experience with the complex inter-faith and
inter-communal dialogues as they are created and lived by real people in Israel and Palestine. Students will travel to major sites in Jerusalem and around Israel, including the Western Wall,
the Haram ash-Sharif, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Yad va-Shem (Holocaust Museum), Masada, Qumran, the Dead Sea, Nazareth, Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Ashkelon. In addition, students
will meet with Jews, Christians, and Muslims who live in and around Jerusalem to discuss what their faith means to them.
HIST 271H-1 RELIG HISTORY: MEDIEVAL WOMEN 1.0 --- A. Miller 5s TT OM 315
HIST 271H In this course we will discuss European Christian, Jewish, and Islamic women and their roles in secular and religious society during the Middle Ages. Additionally we will examine
how these women engaged in personal piety and individual study. Some of the topics we will be looking at specifically include: the religious books commissioned, owned, and used by
medieval European women; the ways in which women such as Hildegard of Bingen and Margery Kempe acted within and outside of gendered roles in medieval Christian society; how women
used daily arts such as textile-making to engage with their local religious leaders and communities; and the role of wives in converting their husbands.
HIST 275-1 RACE, SEX, & EMPIRE: NA 1700 1.0 --- M. Hattem 5s TT OM 301
HIST 275 After 1492, European powers looked to North America as a place to build empires - a quest that, in the everyday, was personal and messy. This class explores the interpersonal
relationships that characterized contact between British, Spanish, French, Native, and African people in North America, comparing the cultural systems, imperial motives, and acts of resistance that were lived out in the bodies of North America's inhabitants before 1700.

MUS 125 The transformation of sound into digital data has profoundly affected the creation, production and distribution of music. With the vast majority of music now mediated by some
form of digitization, even our basic modes of listening have been shaped by it. This course grapples with the implications of this technology, its history, and its broad range of uses and
tools. In doing so, students utilize the Knox Electronic Music Studio to explore the foundational techniques of audio production, synthesis, sampling, podcasting, film scoring, and interactive
software development.

ANSO 275-1 DYING, DEATH, MOURNING 1.0 --- J. Rubin 2 MWF GDH 304
ANSO 275 This course offers an overview of how anthropologists approach the problem of death, dying, burials, and mourning. This class seeks to complicate popular ideas of death as a
universal experience. It does so by examining the diverse ways humans experience the socg rituals, medical procedures, and political processes. In so
doing, students will deepen their understanding of how anthropologists analyze biomedical technologies, political processes, traditional rituals, and material culture surrounding the life
course.
ANSO 276-1 HUMAN RIGHTS & HUMANITARIANISM 1.0 --- J. Rubin 4 MWF GDH 104
ANSO 276 This course explores the difficulties and opportunities that result from putting anthropology into conversation with human rights and humanitarianism. Human Rights and
Humanitarianism are usually premised on a universal model of rights that transcends cultural differences. Anthropology, as the study of human diversity, has had an ambivalent relationship
to such universalist claims. By ethnographically exploring medical humanitarianism, grassroots human rights activism, military humanitarianism, and post-conflict justice, we seek to interrogate the premises, potentials, pitfalls, and power relations of human rights and humanitarianism. We also seek to articulate how anthropologists can productively contribute to and
constructively critique human rights and humanitarian work around the world. Prereq: ANSO 102 or 103 or PREC 124 or permission of the instructor. SA, PI.

ANSO 295FF Sociology is often referred to as the study of social inequality; to that end this course offers studens a brief overview for how the social structures of race, class, gender, and
other variables shape the human experience. This course will also explore the concept of intersectionality and examine how these variables work together in compounding inequality in
society. While the list of variables that promote inequality is extensive, this class will focus most of its attention on issues of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation. Students will be
given the opportunity to explore other dimensions and variables in their assignments. Prerequisite:er ANSO course or permission of the instructor. PI.

ENG 104 By experimenting with encountered and received texts, students will shape their practice through collage, erasure, blackout, and redaction. In some cases, we will salvage language; in other instances, we will upend it. In all iterations, our work will inherently change original documents and their intentóand consider the repercussions of such acts. Our goals in this
course will be to consider recent innovations in found work, to responsibly play among previously made text, and to dismantle those texts in an attempt to reimagine, recover, or revision as
we make beautiful wrecks of them. Students enrolling in the course for a full credit will have an additional project due at termís end.

ENG 245C The Urban Dictionary has this to say about the term Social Justice Warrior: ìat first glance you might think it’s a compliment but it’s not. On the internet it is a sarcastic expression meant to describe people who give REAL social justice a bad name.î What is real social justice and how does one defend it? Why do some people identify as SJWs while others, even
those with the same values and strategies, disavow the term?
In this course, we will read theories of and criticism about issues of social justice. We will also pay particular attut on Tumblr and other social media. For example,
we will follow accounts that belong to self-proclaimed SJWs as well as accounts that attack them, noting similarities or differences in assumptions, goals, rhetoric, and identity. Ultimately,
we will hope to complicate and perhaps even answer the questions above.

ENG 380HH The long poem has always been a generous and mercurial genre characterized by its capacity for inquiry, curiosity, and risk. In the 20th century, poets writing in English repeatedly turned to it as a way of representing, responding to, and interrogating the conditions of their time. In this course, weíll consider how modern and postmodern long poems challenged the
genre and how formal features of their experimentsóe.g. collage, montage, sequence, and resistance to traditional narrative structures—continue to influence contemporary approaches.

We’ll also think about the long poem as a way to respond to and interrogate literary history by considering how poets from underrepresented groups have used it as a revisionist tool.
Possible authors include: T.S. Eliot, H.D., Hart Crane, W. C. Williams, Langston Hughes, Derek Walcott, Anne Carson, and C.D. Wright, among others.

HIST 295V-1 ORIGINS OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM 1.0 --- M. Hattem 5s TT GDH 105
HIST 295V This seminar examines the development of political economy from the colonial period through the Civil War, addressing such issues as the relationship between politics, society,
and the economy and between capitalism and democracy. This course will take political, economic, social, and intellectual approaches to exploring the origins of fundamental questions that
are still at the heart of debates over American political economy, including the proper relationship between the government and the economy, and the fact that American capitalism created
economic and political liberation while also fostering unprecedented oppression and exploitation.
HIST 395L-1 MEDIEVAL WOMEN AND THE LAW 1.0 --- A. Miller 5s TT OM 311
HIST 395L The purpose of this course is to introduce students to how women were included, excluded, and judged under medieval European laws. Medieval women exercised varying levels
of agency in legal proceedings. Some were able to represent themselves and fight for their legal rights while others were excluded from legal activity. Because medieval legal systems often
practiced ‘difference law’ most medieval laws were written with the assumption that they only applieve different statutes and
codes that address situations particular to women, most often offenses against womenís bodies. Thus, regardless of how many particular women actually engaged in seeking legal recourse,
medieval legal systems often either excluded women all together, placed them under the legal authority of their closest male relatives, or applied separate laws based on gender.
Prerequisites: HIST 285; HIST 105, 271H or equivalent class on the Middle Ages is encouraged.

examines how people experience displacement, migration, and statelessness; how home, community and belonging are reconstituted both in exile and through the making of diaspora communities. We will also pursue related questions of how international laws, national policies, and practices of social exclusion/inclusion influence the broader context of migration. How do
population movements affect politics at all levels? In what ways are relations of kinship and gender being reformulated in response to transnational movements? Reading materials will
include ethnographic studies of migrant and diaspora communities, policy reports on the international refugee regime, literary works produced by migrant authors, and mainstream media
reporting on immigration in the US and around the globe.

We will examine a wide range of behaviors including: subcultures, prostitution, street
and other kinds of crime, and those stigmatized based on their identity or behavior.

strangest shapes occur in the ocean, and yet typical on-campus courses such as Biology of Fishes and Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy do not have the opportunity to truly explore these
fascinating animals. In this off-campus experience, we will stay on an island-based marine lab in the Atlantic Ocean and dissect likely dozens of marine animals, including necropsy experiences with seals, dolphins, and sea turtles. Through dissection and description, we will explore these fascinating biological forms. Prereq: BIOL 321 or 325 or permission of the instructor.

the upheavals and reconfigurations caused by foreign invasions, to postcolonialism and the Black Freedom Movement in the USA.

ENG 245D In the middle of the 20th century, a new type of feminism emerged in the U.S. that quickly developed into a serious political and cultural project. Often in partnership with other
civil rights and anti-war activists, for example, the women’s movement(s) and their critiques of power challenged much of the country’s establishment. In this course, we will consider the
effects of the women’s movement on the establishment of American poetry, its authorship, subject matter, production, and publication, exploring the ways in which poetry functioned as
both an arm of the movement and a mirror of its challenges.

for promoting justice and peace. Blending political, economic, religious, ethical, and sociocultural perspectives, the course will encourage students to reflect on racial, gendered, economic,
and political inequality, as well as on systemic causes of conflict and violence. Through study of historic and contemporary examples of real-world conflict resolution and social transformation, students will develop analytical skills to better understand, critically evaluate, and respond to contemporary issues of peace and justice.

PHIL 195A This course analyzes social and ethical issues in medicine and medical research. Specifically, we will explore the relationships between patient and caregiver, caregiver and corporation, and corporation and patient. To do so, we will read and analyze arguments from philosophers, caregivers, medical scientists, social scientists, and business professionals. The
class will focus on three main topics: bodily autonomy, bodily authority, and medicine as business. Among our main questions will be: What professional and ethical obligations do medical
caregivers have to patients? Can and should children consent to plastic surgery? What is the limit of understanding medicine as a profit-driven enterprise?

PHIL 295U Friedrich Nietzsche is recognized as one of the most important philosophers of 19th century. The goal of this course is to understand the reasons for that reputation and
whether that reputation is merited. To that end, we will read several works which span Nietzsche's scholarly life in order to understand his continuing influence on ethics, philosophy of language, existentialism, along with his rejection of modernity and his proposal for a post-modern society and post-modern humanity, etc.

to and understand the interplay between rules, authority, fairness, and individual and collective agency and responsibility. Aside from the political socialization provided by sport, a key intersection of sport and politics that we examine is the use of sport to further intrastate and interstate cooperation and peace. These impacts furter include but are not limited to the role of
sport in fostering identity, furthering national interest, and reinforcing or challenging societal norms.

W. Du 7-10 pm M BORZ 116
ASIA 125 This course will take a critical look at widely acclaimed films in Chinese cinema from the 1940s to today, produced in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. This course will ask
students to engage with issues of culture, history, and meaning. We will especially focus on what goes into the classification of a "masterpiece," including the context, content, and significance of each film. In other words, the class will explore the relationship between film and socio-historical context, novel storytelling and technique, and each film's lasting influence. No
knowledge of Chinese language is required.

GERM 151 This course will examine German films (alongside some graphic novels and other texts) which take as their subject historical moments and events. We will examine the manner in
which German culture views its own history via mass, popular media such as film. Such media necessarily generate collective memories and historical imaginaries which may or may not
comport with historical fact. Themes may include (but aren't limited to) the legacy of the Holocaust and World War II, the division and unification of Germany, and migrants' experiences.

SPAN 330 Anarchist Culture in Spain: A study of Spanish Anarchism from the end of the 19th century until the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) as a precursor to many of the cultural practices
that we consider normal or desirable today, such as the eight-hour work day, the defense of civil rights, the participation of women in political and working life, the use of contraception, free
love, the conservation of the environment, secular public education, universal health care, vegetarianism or even nudism. We will study anarchist productions of art and propaganda from
diverse genres such as journalism, cinema, graphic art, poetry, theater, and romance novels. The legacy of this cultural heritage in present day anarchism in Spain will also be considered.
Taught in Spanish. Prerequisites: SPAN 230A and SPAN 235.

media representations shape political conflicts in three ethnographic sites: 1) Northern Ireland; 2) Palestine-Israel; and 3) post-apartheid South Africa. Finally, we will study the fields of
power related to media production in each local context: who has the power to write/film, and thus represent, the realities of the conflict? Which voices are silenced in these accounts? How
can we reconstruct radical or marginalized voices within these representations of conflict? Readings will explore scholarly texts on global political conflicts as well as related works by novelists, artists, journalists, and filmmakers. Pending approval

AFST 386E In this course we will explore plays by women of color, focusing on those writers who are based in the United States and whose plays have been produced from 2000 to the
present. We will read and discuss plays by writers of Black, Latina, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Native American identity groups. We will take as a given the intersectionality of these writers'
experiences, and we will consider the ways in which race and gender are examined, both explicitly and implicitly, in their plays. We will survey the wide array of subject matter, themes, and
forms utilized by the playwrights, supplementing our readings and discussions with biographical and contextual information that will help to frame our experience of the plays. Finally, we will
investigate the unique opportunities inherent in theatre to stage marginalized perspectives, to question the supposed givens of race and gender in today's society. Prerequisites: Junior

ANSO 212 What role does culture play in the practice, provisioning, and experience of medicine? This course serves as an introduction to the key theoretical frameworks, ethical concerns,
and empirical areas of research for medical anthropology. Moving beyond narrow conceptions of health as a solely biological process, we will focus on the complex ways that illness, health,
and healing are entwined in social, economic, political, and cultural webs. Drawing on case studies from around the world, we look at a series of tensions that characterize the field:
between biomedical and non-biomedical views of bodies, diseases, and health; between local understandings of health and an increasingly globalized systems of medical knowledge and
practice; between the politics inherent in medical care and the political governance of access to health care; between health as a liberating condition and medicine as a vector of both productive and repressive power. Pending approval.

grassroots activism. This course will explore the power and limits of the media in contemporary social movements in recent historical contexts. First, we will examine the political and economic
conditions that have led to popular mobilizations against local injustices in the last decade. Second, we will look at a range of critical perspectives on whether and how media technologies have
been instrumental in the messaging and circulation of activists' claims. Course readings draw from anthropological debates over media, visual arts, public spaces, and social movements.

Informed by spatial and postcolonial theories, this class examines the interrelated concepts of race, environmental determinism, and colonization in Greco-Roman antiquity and these concepts' influence on ideas about identity and the environment in later time periods, including our own. Students gain a background in the history and literature of the ancient Mediterranean,
learn to analyze primary sources and critically evaluate secondary sources, and develop their persuasive speaking and writing skills.

ENG 245F-1 ATHEISM FOR LENT 1.0 PI,IC G. Franco 3s TT OM 201
ENG 245F In his book Suspicion and Faith, Merold Westphal proposes "the serious and sustained reading of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud as a Lenten penance." He suggests that atheistic
texts might be read as "God-given instruments of our own cleansing and renewal," exposing the self-deceptions we may enact in everyday religious practices. This class will take up
Westphal's challenge by reading atheist philosophical texts alongside literary works which critique religion in a variety of settingsùincluding 19th century America with its racial injustices,
18th century Britain with its rapacious capitalism, and 17th century Japan where colonialist fantasies mix with unexamined religious zeal. We will explore the contents of Christopher
Hichen's anthology, The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever. We will ask: how are religious concepts used to oppress and control others? What happens when theology
becomes a justification of the self? Prereq: ENG 105 or 120 or 125 or 200.

FREN 330D From the juvenile "liar, liar pants on fire" to the biblical verse: "Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight", the act or the art of lying always
appears to be stigmatized. But why lie? What makes a person a liar or an impostor? Are they the same? It is around these questions that philosophers and writers have gravitated and tried
to decipher if lying could be justified or has to be punished systematically. Are there any real white lies? Are there any good lies? Does everybody lie? Commonly, French people are viewed
to be direct and frank, but does French literature reflect this? How does French literature treat lies? Is it different from English literature? Does literature always lie? Prerequisites: for French
students--FREN 215 or any literature course or permission of the instructor; for others--any literature course and sophomore standing.

GWST 386E In this course we will explore plays by women of color, focusing on those writers who are based in the United States and whose plays have been produced from 2000 to the
present. We will read and discuss plays by writers of Black, Latina, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Native American identity groups. We will take as a given the intersectionality of these writers'
experiences, and we will consider the ways in which race and gender are examined, both explicitly and implicitly, in their plays. We will survey the wide array of subject matter, themes, and
forms utilized by the playwrights, supplementing our readings and discussions with biographical and contextual information that will help to frame our experience of the plays. Finally, we will
investigate the unique opportunities inherent in theatre to stage marginalized perspectives, to question the supposed givens of race and gender in today's society. Prerequisites: Junior

HIST 363-1 AMERICAN LIBERALISM 1.0 SA,PI K. Hamilton 5s TT OM 311
HIST 363 What does it mean to be a liberal? Why does liberalism evoke such strong reactions, pro and con? Where does American liberalism come from, and where is it going? From
Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal through Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, liberalism is synonymous with some of the most daring and innovative public policy of the twentieth century. But
more than this, liberalism has always represented a set of philosophies, values, and beliefs; animating discussions on American culture, economy, education, media, politics, human identity(ies), and more. This research seminar offers each student the opportunity to conduct their own in-depth examination of liberalism, using advanced historical research to focus upon a specific aspect of personal interest. Students will be required to participate in classroom discussion and to complete an independent research project. Prerequisite: HIST 285

PSYC 395K Do you trust your "gut feelings"? Interoceptionùthe sense of the physiological condition of the bodyùis a ubiquitous, yet subtle psychological process that affects human experience and behavior, and can become dysregulated in psychopathology. Theories of emotion have long speculated that physiological information from the body plays an important role in emotional reactions, experience, and behavior. Modern neuroscientific and psychological research on interoception expands and specifies these influences, revealing complex relationships
between subjective somatic experience and social behavior and outcomes. The field of "social interoception" is a growing area of social neuroscience/psychology that has important implications for understanding psychopathology, empathy, subjective well-being, and contemplative practices such as meditation and yoga.

essays, memoirs, and other works drawn from a variety of religious or spiritual expressions. Discussions consider such subjects as the nature and challenges of autobiographical writing, the
adequacy of language and image to the task of relating spiritual experience, and the influences of culture and personal history on religious self-identity. W; Prereq: Sophomore standing and

including post-colonial, critical race and post-structuralist theory. The course aims to deal with central themes of white supremacist settler-colonialism, the racialized built environment and
the reification of ethnic identity. Prerequisite: AFST 101 or AFST 145.

AFST 208-1 BLACK LIVES MATTER 1.0 SA,PI Y. Marshall 4 MWF
AFST 208 This course examines the history of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. It considers it in its historical specificity as a 2010-2020s US activist movement, in its global (and viral)
dimensions, and in its departures and intersections with other black intellectual movements. The course examines invisibility and spectacle in black death, voyeurism, and the significance of
the destruction of the black body in the new public square. We ask whether it is true that black lives are more easily taken and black bodies destroyed with less legal consequence than others: What are the ways in which black lives do not matter? In search for our answers this course analyzes media coverage and debates on social media about black death. We place these
discussions in conversation with the critique of race and racialized violence offered in literature, music, film and social theory. Open to first-year students.

ANSO 310-1 POL OF SCIENCE, MEDICINE & TECHN 1.0 --- J. Rubin 5s TT
ANSO 310 In popular understanding, we tend to think of scientists, doctors, and engineers as occupying apolitical positions. While debates over government funding priorities or diversity in
the laboratory occasionally pop up, we imagine scientists at the laboratory bench, striving for the discovery of objective truths; doctors discovering cures for natural ailments; and engineers
seeking to innovate new solutions to technical problems. By contradistinction, this course begins from the premise that science, technology, and medicine are inherently political acts. That
is, they are both the product of social conditions and, in turn, the condition of possibility for our ways of life. In calling science, medicine, and technology political acts, we do not seek to dismiss their forms of practice (nor, for many of the authors we read, their claims to objectivity). In this course, we strive to understand how the existence of these expert communities affect
and are affected by democratic politics.

Bodies changing into new forms, gods behaving badly, and the transcendent power of the written word: the Metamorphoses, an epic poem by the Roman poet Ovid, tracks the entirety of
Greek mythology from the creation of the universe to his own lifetime via a series of transformations. In this class, we will read the Metamorphoses in English and examine its reception from
the Middle Ages to the present day. This class is 0.5 credit and there are no prerequisites. You do not need to have any background in classics or mythology. Students who have already

GERM 155 Ideas that came out of German Enlightenment spread throughout Europe and beyond. Tolerance, one of the core ideals of the Enlightenment, always faces its opposite, intolerance. This course provides an in-depth look at the reverberations of German Enlightenment in various forms of tolerance and intolerance in literature and film. Political, social, and religious
tolerance and intolerance are examined through literature, film and theoretical ttorical moments, times of political unease, cases of religious mistreatment or coexistence
etc. Specific attention is paid to topics such as racism, instances of political persecution, and interreligious amity. For each literary work or film, students get a historical background and
examine the work with the help of theoretical discussions. Students will gain perspectives on diverse forms of tolerance and intolerance in different contexts.

PHIL 195B-1 MEDITATION IN PHIL, ETHICS, REL .5 --- W. Young 3 MWF
PHIL 195B Meditation has received scant attention in western philosophy. This course aims to (re)claim meditation as a topic of philosophical concern. It specifically exams meditation as
(1) a form of inquiry intended to establish knowledge in conformity with rational inquiry, (2) a moral practice intended to transform emotion and character for the betterment of the meditator,

Course-Sec SU Course Title Cr Elements Faculty Period Days
and (3) a religious exercise intended to secure access to the divine, not otherwise available to rational inquiry. In effect, this course asks whether reason marks the limits of human understanding and is the only means by which we should engage the world.
PHIL 195C-1 TRANSHUMANISM .5 --- W. Young 3 MWF
PHIL 195C Transhumanism addresses a range of issues connected with the technological enhancement of humans, made possible by developments in medicine, genetics, molecular biology, nanotechnology, and computer science. These developments appear to place human evolution within human choice, opening up the possibility of the human-made human rather than the
human as an artifice of nature (or God). Starting with an analysis of what transhumanism is, this course will consider whether and how humans might be biologically and cognitively altered,
as well as issues of social justice regarding the proposed changes.

PHIL 295X This class analyzes ethical issues that arise in the use of technology, especially communications technology and automation. Who is responsible for injury and death caused by
automated vehicles and weapons? How do 'autonomous' vehicles and other forms of AI recreate the biases and prejudices of their inventors? How do social media platforms and other
forms of communications technology either facilitate or inhibit personal autonomy for individuals? Do social media platforms have ethical obligations to stop the spread of fake news and
other misinformation? We will read arguments from philosophers, scientists, and social scientists.
PHIL 295Y-1 GERMANIC ETHN ID, NATLSM, CRISIS 1.0 --- L. Kleszyk 5s TT
PHIL 295 In this course, we consider questions about ethnic identity, nationalism, and their relationship to both political and personal crisis. What does it mean to have an ethnic identity?
How is nationalism related to an ethnic identity? How do concepts of ethnic and national identity relate to the basic philosophical conceptions of self and other? How are solutions to the
problems between self and other related to the manner in which the relationship between self and other is originally conceived? German-language texts from mostly 20th century thinkers will
serve as a basis for an understanding the philosophy of 20th century Germanic nationalism as well as responses to it.

Anthropogenic climate change is accepted as the primary type of change by a majority of those who research climate change. Humans stand at the center of this, whether being the cause of, experiencing the consequences of, and/or helping
resolve this drastic change to our planet. Human behavior and psychology are a necessay component of any attempt o understand and successfully navigate the changing world. This course
takes human psychology as central to questions of climate change and will cover, in an interdisciplinary fashion, subfields of psychology such as social, evolutionary, cognitive, motivation,
positive, psychopathology, and lifespan development. Psychological findings will be used to understand different aspects of climate change. Prerequisites: PSYC 205 and 202, or PSYC 369,

AFST 208 This course examines the history of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. It considers it in its historical specificity as a 2010-2020s US activist movement, in its global (and viral)
dimensions, and in its departures and intersections with other black intellectual movements. The course examines invisibility and spectacle in black death, voyeurism, and the significance of
the destruction of the black body in the new public square. We ask whether it is true that black lives are more easily taken and black bodies destroyed with less legal consequence than others: What are the ways in which black lives do not matter? In search for our answers this course analyzes media coverage and debates on social media about black death. We place these
discussions in conversation with the critique of race and racialized violence offered in literature, music, film and social theory. Open to first-year students.

ENG 245B "Poetry," Auden famously said, "makes nothing happen." In this multi-genre course, we will engage his claim by exploring texts that cast artists as potential disruptors of power
structures. Under what conditions might art become an act of resistance and to what ends? When and how do the conventions of genre, or language itself, become systems of oppression?
How might writers intervene? We will consider artists and audiences in the fiction of Franz Kafka, James Baldwin, and Don DeLillo; we will grapple with the intricate interrogations of power
and complicity in the nonfiction of James Agee and Eula Biss; and we will study the innovations of poets like Muriel Rukeyser and Layli Long Soldier, among others.

HIST 167 This course seeks to recover the shifting history of what gender and sexual identity have meant in American history to the present day. Personal choice, cultural possibility, and the
operations of the state have all come together to shape the ways in which people experienced sex and attraction (or didn't), and understood masculinity, femininity, and non-binary identities
over time. Through readings, short stories, oral histories, illustrations, and photographs we'll engage with this history in search of a more complex understanding of present-day debates
around these issues.

RELS 241B-1 RELIGION AND SCIENCE FICTION 1.0 --- J. Thrall 5s TT
RELS 241B Speculative fiction in the various incarnations of science fiction and fantasy wanders perennially in realms traditionally considered the purview of religion, asking questions about
the ordering of the universe, the nature of existence, and the proper basis for human (and non-human) relations. Through careful reading/viewing of novels, short stories, movies and television episodes, this course will explore the ways science fiction and some fantasy invent systems of meaning that are either explicitly or implicitly religious, both in recasting or adapting
received religious forms, and in imagining new forms of their own.

THTR 386G As the U.S. enters a presidential election season, we are consistently presented with competing narratives of nation, nationalism, and national identity. Staging the Nation
explores how (historically and currently) the theatre articulates and questions notions of national identity and presents alternative narratives of nation and nationalism. Postcolonial writer
Homi Bhabha describes the process of Nation and Narration, in which national identity is never fixed but always in process as it is narrated by its people. Staging the Nation extends that
process of narration to the stage, where artists literally stage identity through dramatic and theatrical works articulating ideas of national identity and nationhood within the U.S.A. and its
intersections with other nations in the context of state-funded National Theatres.

history in the American culture is relatively recent. Through an exploration of literature by American writers we will encounter the landscape through lenses ranging from frontiersmen to
adventurers to environmentalists seeking to preserve and honor those who existed long before modern civilization altered it. This course is a complement to Prof. Gilbert's Native Arts of the
Americas course, and Prof. Godsil's Spirit of the Desert: Exploring the Southwest, that will culminate during spring break when 2 or 3 faculty will take students to multiple puebloan ruins
sites in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, & Utah. Gilbert and Kitchen Fitch courses are not required but useful for trip participation. Godsil's .5 credit course is required for students intending

SPAN 208-1 FLAMENCO .5 --- F. Gomez 5s TT
SPAN 208 From the poorest and most marginalized areas of 19th-century Andalucia, Spain emerged a unique musical art form known as flamenco that has since mesmerized audiences
across the globe. In this course, students acquire basic vocabulary to analyze and discuss key features of flamenco singing, dance, and guitar, including the various song structures (palos)
that constitute flamenco as a musical genre. Attention to the cultural traditions of Andalucia that involve flamenco is also essential, as is the influence that certain ethnic groups, particularly
the gitanos (Romani) of Andalucia, have had on the art form over time. Taught in Spanish. No prior knowledge of music is necessary.
SPAN 209-1 BUSINESS SPANISH .5 --- F. Gomez 5s TT

other professional contexts in the Spanish-speaking world. Designed for students who hope to use Spanish for business purposes, in the public sector (education, medical, social services),
in a non-profit organization, for community organization, and/or for activism. Taught in Spanish.

SPAN 330K Anarchist Culture in Spain: A study of Spanish Anarchism from the end of the 19th century until the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) as a precursor to many of the cultural practices
that we consider normal or desirable today, such as the eight-hour work day, the defense of civil rights, the participation of women in political and working life, the use of contraception, free
love, the conservation of the environment, secular public education, universal health care, vegetarianism or even nudism. We will study anarchist productions of art and propaganda from
diverse genres such as journalism, cinema, graphic art, poetry, theater, and romance novels. The legacy of this cultural heritage in present day anarchism in Spain will also be considered.
Taught in Spanish. Prerequisites: SPAN 230A and SPAN 235.

ANSO 254 This course examines multi-faceted systems that make possible the daily food we eat on the Knox campus and beyond. Through systems thinking and agroecological approaches,
we consider the sources of our food, the ways people are socially connected, divided, and organized through food, the labor conditions and environmental consequences of small and largescale agriculture, and the post-consumer routes of food. Through readings, films, site visits, and hands-on participation, we cover a range of practical, ethical, and logistical challenges and
opportunities in our understanding of and engagements with local, regional, and global food systems. Prereq: One previous course in ANSO or ENVS.

ANSO 345 In this course, we examine the recent wave of violence perpetrated by non-, para-, and state actors in Latin America through an ethnographic perspective and place these ethnographies into conversation with social scientific approaches to crime, violence, and human rights. In this context, we ask: What constitutes criminal activity and who decides the answer to this
question? How and when does crime threaten the state? What is the relationship between the violence of state and non-state actors? How can we rethink globalization through the lens of
criminal activity? Readings will examine the experience of crime in post-Civil War San Salvador, criminality resulting from the experience of crime in post-Civil War San Salvador, criminality
resulting from the securitization of the U.S.-Mexico border, the mirroring of criminal and state enterprises in Brazil, and surveillance technologies in Mexico City. Prereqs: sophmore standing
and 2 ANSO courses, or permission of the instructor.

ENG 380W A critical and comprehensive study of Sendak's key works for children, including the groundbreaking picture book trilogy: Where the Wild Things Are, In the Night Kitchen, and
Outside Over There; the aesthetic influences (from Mozart to Blake to Laurel and Hardy) that inform Sendak's narrative art; and Sendak as a cultural force whose modern mythology helped
redefine our notions of childhood and whose pop cultural reach has extended from Broadway to Spike Jonze films to wild thing hoodies. Of special consideration is the figure of the child in
Sendak's work, its origins as well as its monstrous and angelic incarnations.
