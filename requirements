ANSO 246 Working: The Experience, Structure, and Culture of Work in the U.S.

Work is one of our fundamental social activities. Our jobs define our identities, structure our days, and condition how we interpret the world around us. At the same time, work stratifies our population, creating highly divergent social and economic opportunities based on occupation and income. In this course, we use a range of sociological approaches to investigate the shape, nature, meaning, and outcome of work in the U.S., linking social theory, the everyday experience of work, and the sociopolitical structure of society.

ANSO 256 Examining the Anthropocene

In the early 21st century, the term 'Anthropocene' emerged to characterize the increasingly extensive impact of human generated transformations of ecological, geological, and biological processes at global proportions. This class examines the arguments surrounding the concept of the Anthropocene and accelerated demands on natural resources and corresponding eco-systemic pressures. We incorporate the insights of cultural ecology regarding the interrelationships of social, political, and economic organization and the local and regional environments within which humans live. Through ethnographic case studies, we examine the contested social and political fields in which people are making sense of, adapting to, and engaging these global transformations. Prerequisite(s): A 100-level ANSO course or ENVS 101 or permission of the instructor; Cross Listing: ENVS 256; Offered alternate years, in spring; W. Hope

ANSO 260 Topics and Methods in Ethnomusicology

ANSO 262 Law and Society

Law shapes our day to day lives in countless ways, from mundane disputes over parking violations to urgent struggles over community policing and the use of lethal force. In this class, we will study law as a social institution and "law in action", which is often at variance with "law on the books". This requires examining both the role of official legal institutions (courts) and legal actors (judges, lawyers, etc.) as well as the ways in which law operates through implicit norms, symbols, and public institutions. In addition, as some of you may have an interest in pursuing a legal career, we will consider how the legal profession and the practice of law have changed over time and the enduring hierarchies that have remained. We will ask questions such as �what makes us follow the law?� and �how does law affect our daily lives?� How is the law mobilized and deployed by professionals and ordinary citizens? And finally, as a social institution, how has the law both reflected and reinforced inequality over time? Reading materials will focus on the micro-politics of legal interaction within neighborhoods, communities, workplaces, families, and social movements. Prerequisite(s): Sophomore standing or permission of the instructor; M. Ran-Rubin

ANSO 270 Language and Culture

An examination of the relationship of language to culture and social organization.

ANSO 275 Dying, Death, and Mourning

This course offers an overview of how anthropologists approach the problem of death, dying, burials, and mourning. This class seeks to complicate popular ideas of death as a universal experience. It does so by examining the diverse ways humans experience the social and biological fact of death using rituals, medical procedures, and political processes. In so doing, students will deepen their understanding of how anthropologists analyze biomedical technologies, political processes, traditional rituals, and material culture surrounding the life course. Prerequisite(s): one course in Anthropology and Sociology or permission of the instructor; Cross Listing: LAST 275; SA; J. Rubin

ANSO 276 Human Rights and Humanitarianism: Anthropological Approaches

This course explores the difficulties and opportunities that result from putting anthropology into conversation with human rights and humanitarianism. Human Rights and Humanitarianism are usually premised on a universal model of rights that transcends cultural differences. Anthropology, as the study of human diversity, has had an ambivalent relationship to such universalist claims. By ethnographically exploring medical humanitarianism, grassroots human rights activism, military humanitarianism, and post-conflict justice, we seek to interrogate the premises, potentials, pitfalls, and power relations of human rights and humanitarianism. We also seek to articulate how anthropologists can productively contribute to and constructively critique human rights and humanitarian work around the world. Prerequisite(s): ANSO 102 or 103 or PREC 124 or permission of the instructor; SA, PI; Offered alternate years; J. Rubin

ANSO 280 - ANSO 281 Social Service Internship

This course combines experiential learning and academic study to investigate the practical, social and theoretical issues of social work. At the beginning of this two-term, two-credit course sequence, students are placed as interns in local social service organizations. Students have interned with a wide variety of populations (e.g. the elderly, the developmentally delayed, at-risk teens, domestic violence victims) across a broad range of issues and practices (e.g. teen reproductive health and education, public housing, Teen Court, individual counseling, legal assistance). In the classroom, students discuss and analyze their internship experiences, while also exploring the principles of introductory social work practice.

ANSO 321 Microsociology: Explorations into Everyday Life

Microsociology is the study of the taken-for-granted world of everyday interaction. Proceeding from the assumption that people cannot help but engage in interpretation and meaning making as they move through their daily lives, this course aims to uncover the patterns and structures by which these interpretations are made. We assume that common sense, group action, and social institutions are "achievements" that must be explained through the study of face-to-face interaction. Topics in this course include the structures of interaction, the production of reality, the self, conversational patterns, and the interactional foundations of social institutions. Prerequisite(s): One ANSO course or permission of the instructor; Offered alternate years; G. Raley

ANSO 326 Psychological Anthropology: Self, Culture, and Society

How is our subjective experience of ourselves and others shaped by the social and cultural context in which we live? How might one investigate this? Are Western accounts of human psychology valid cross-culturally? Drawing on recent research in the field of psychological anthropology, this course takes a comparative approach to such topics as emotional experience and its expression, gender identity, the role of power in social life, language and discursive practices, notions of self and personhood, and the indigenous representation of these in various 'folk theories' or ethnopsychologies. Prerequisite(s): two courses in Anthropology and Sociology and junior standing; ANSO 102 recommended; Cross Listing: GWST 326; Offered occasionally; N. Eberhardt

ANSO 328 Race & Gender in the U.S. Welfare State

This course examines how political, economic, and cultural ideologies regarding race and gender work(ed) to frame the conception and creation of both the U.S. Welfare State and U.S. welfare policy. We will engage these ideas through an historical exploration of the ways that the U.S. Welfare State was enacted, framed, and codified through policy. In addition we will analyze how the creation of the Welfare State and its subsequent policies reflect American identity and cultural norms, and reinforce social inequities along racial and gendered lines.

ANSO 341 Anthropology of the Senses

This course explores a basic premise: sensory perception is as much a cultural act as a physical or biological function. In this class, we will consider a number of scholarly debates and concerns regarding the inter-relations of the senses with historically dynamic human bodily experience. What does it mean to study the senses? What are the possible relationships among physiological capacities; social, political, and economic organizations; and their corresponding relations of power? How might we examine the various ways in which food, drink, art, music, dance, and other corporeal practices are mediated through personal and collective ideologies and practices around the affective and the sensual? Prerequisite(s): Two courses in the department or permission of the instructor; Offered alternate years, in winter; W. Hope

ANSO 342 Sound Cultures

In this course, we examine how sounds are enacted through diverse cultural practices and invested with individual and collective meanings. We engage these phenomena through sensory ethnographies, films, cultural histories of sound reproduction technologies, and soundscape mapping. Students will refine their ethnographic techniques to document and make sense of the acoustic ecologies of Knox County and beyond. Prerequisite(s): ANSO 102 or ANSO/MUS 260; Offered alternate years, in winter; W. Hope

ANSO 344 Power of the Past: Memory, History, Forgetting

From conflicts over Confederate monuments to battles over school textbooks, from lawsuits seeking monetary reparations for state violence to the proliferation of historical museums, the question of how to narrate the past is increasingly central to the ways we define our individual and collective identities. In this class, we examine how anthropological theory and ethnographic practice can contribute to understanding the stakes of historical representation. In so doing, we ask: How do societies remember their past? How should they? What is at stake in labeling certain narrations of the past as "history" and others as "memory?" And how does the way we describe the past reflect, affect, and transform relations of power in the present? Prerequisite(s): Sophomore standing and two ANSO courses, or permission of the instructor; Offered alternate years; J. Rubin

ANSO 370 Language and Social Identity

This course explores the anthropology study of language and its relationships to individual, ethnic, and national identities. We consider selected cases, examining the political, economic, and other sociocultural factors which shape patterns of language loyalties, language use, and language policies. Since the power of various major languages to evoke loyalty and to advance the interests of certain social groups crosses international boundaries, we examine some of the processes involved in the spread of world languages, particularly English.

AFST 227 The Black Image in American Film

Since the beginning of the American film industry, white, black and other filmmakers have used the black image to interrogate American identity. This course focuses upon the often contentious dialog between white and black filmmakers, critics, and activists over the creation and control of the black image - a struggle that has been a fundamental component of the American film industry since its creation. Examination of this artistic conflict helps students to explore the larger social struggles and issues surrounding race in American society, as well as to experience the richness of African American culture and the vibrant history of American film and criticism. Above all, students learn to see the political, social and economic context in which film is created, viewed, and understood. Some of the issues to be discussed include: the black aesthetic; representations of the black family, religion, and gender/sexuality by Hollywood vs. independent black films; the changing black image in film over time; the business and economics of filmmaking.

AMST 227 The Black Image in American Film

Since the beginning of the American film industry, white, black and other filmmakers have used the black image to interrogate American identity. This course focuses upon the often contentious dialog between white and black filmmakers, critics, and activists over the creation and control of the black image - a struggle that has been a fundamental component of the American film industry since its creation. Examination of this artistic conflict helps students to explore the larger social struggles and issues surrounding race in American society, as well as to experience the richness of African American culture and the vibrant history of American film and criticism. Above all, students learn to see the political, social and economic context in which film is created, viewed, and understood. Some of the issues to be discussed include: the black aesthetic; representations of the black family, religion, and gender/sexuality by Hollywood vs. independent black films; the changing black image in film over time; the business and economics of filmmaking.

AMST 362 Themes in African-American Political Thought Since Emancipation

This course is not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of all black American thinkers since 1865, nor is it meant as a strictly chronological exercise. Rather, the focus is how fundamental themes in black political thought recur, overlap, and intertwine. These themes are studied as they appear in the writings and speeches from a wide spectrum of selected thinkers and activists. Among other themes, we consider how the accommodationism of Booker T. Washington, the Pan Africanism of Marcus Garvey, the Islamic fundamentalism of Malcolm X, and the Afrocentricity of Haki Madhubuti are all connected by a fundamental emphasis upon black capitalism. By contrast, the theme of Marxist influence are studied through the careers and writings of socialist labor leader A. Phillip Randolph, entertainer and activist Paul Robeson, Black Panther founder Huey Newton, and Communist and political prisoner Angela Davis. The themes of assimilation, acculturation, and African-American citizenship are linked through the writings of W.E.B. DuBois and James Baldwin, the direct action protest movement of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the presidential campaigns of Jesse Jackson. Additional themes are suggested by the writings of Alexander Crummell, Anna Julia Cooper, Mary Church Terrell, bell hooks, and Molefi Asante.

ENG 247 Moral Life in Literature

Literature raises two different types of moral questions: those concerned with the moral parameters guiding the creative process and those dealing with the moral issues raised from within the literary work itself. This course examines both issues. Regarding the former, we ask: Must good literature be moral or can an accomplished work of art be immoral? If there are moral guidelines for the production of literature, what are they? Regarding the latter, we use literature to better understand particular moral issues. What, for example, can literature add to our understanding of friendship, courage, community and the pursuit of individuality? In short, how can novelists help us better understand the human good?

FILM 227 The Black Image in American Film

Since the beginning of the American film industry, white, black and other filmmakers have used the black image to interrogate American identity. This course focuses upon the often contentious dialog between white and black filmmakers, critics, and activists over the creation and control of the black image - a struggle that has been a fundamental component of the American film industry since its creation. Examination of this artistic conflict helps students to explore the larger social struggles and issues surrounding race in American society, as well as to experience the richness of African American culture and the vibrant history of American film and criticism. Above all, students learn to see the political, social and economic context in which film is created, viewed, and understood. Some of the issues to be discussed include: the black aesthetic; representations of the black family, religion, and gender/sexuality by Hollywood vs. independent black films; the changing black image in film over time; the business and economics of filmmaking.

�Let them eat cake�, �bon app�tit�, are common expressions used in English to either refer to Marie-Antoinette's faux pas before the hungry revolutionary crowd asking for bread in front of the Versailles palace, or to traditionally tell somebody to enjoy their meal. More than mere food, French cuisine and dishes have become an art and an inspiration throughout the world. But how are food and cuisine at the core of French culture? How is food such a savoir-vivre for the French people? Brillat-Savarin said in the 18th century: �Tell me what you eat: I'll tell you who you are�. How did/do French people eat? How did/does that define them? What is the place of food and cuisine in literature? This course aims at better understanding the representations and the symbolic aspects of food and cuisine in French literature as well as in its culture. Providing starters from the Middle-Ages, we will take our culinary discovery through the tasty 17th century to the spicy 18th century, adding a dash of table manners and theory in the 19th century to modern time diets and regimens, mixing a variety of formats and recipes. Prerequisite(s): FREN 215 or any French Literature course at the 300 level; A. Schaefer

FREN 330G Money in Literature

From mere survival to absolute control, money becomes a leitmotiv that philosophers, writers, and movie directors have constantly described and commented on. This course aims at better understanding the representations of money in French literature from the classical to modern times by analyzing a variety of formats. Prerequisite(s): FREN 215; A.

Today, we often look back to ancient Greece, particularly Athens, as the foundation of modern, western culture, but how much do we really know about life in Greece? And why should we care? This class seeks to answer these questions and others as we examine the history of ancient Greek cities, their institutions, and cultural achievements. Chronologically, we cover the Bronze Age to the Classical period. This class includes the traditional military and political history of ancient Greece, but we also learn about ancient Greek society as a whole and consider the cultural foundation of ancient life. By the end of this class, students should understand both the overall shape of ancient Greek history and culture, and how historians know what they know about the ancient Greek past.

Second, these perspectives will be used to consider specific international service initiatives conceived for and implemented in a variety of contexts (e.g., the Peace Corps; American Red Cross; religious, health, and educational organizations). Finally, the effects of international service initiatives upon their intended constituencies (e.g., cultural imperialism, self determination, continuity of impact, professionalism) will be examined.

LAST 345 Crime and Policing in Latin America

From San Salvador to Rio de Janeiro and from Mexico City to Bogota, a number of Latin American cities now frequently proclaim themselves to be "the most violent city in the world." In this course, we examine the recent wave of violence perpetrated by non-, para-, and state actors in Latin America through an ethnographic perspective and place these ethnographies into conversation with social scientific approaches to crime, violence, and human rights. Examining law breaking in the 21st century provides a lens through which to work through the meanings of states, citizenship, and identity. In this context, we ask: What constitutes criminal activity and who decides the answer to this question? How and when does crime threaten the state? What is the relationship between the violence of state and non-state actors? How can we rethink globalization through the lens of criminal activity? Readings will examine the experience of crime in post-Civil War San Salvador, criminality resulting from the securitization of the U.S.-Mexico border, the mirroring of criminal and state enterprises in Brazil, and surveillance technologies in Mexico City.

In brief, metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the natures of things. In this course, students will be introduced to the study of metaphysics by considering such questions as: (1) Is a hotdog a sandwich? (2) Does a band or sports team become a new entity each time it loses or gains members? (3) Are characters in works of fan fiction properly "the same" characters as those in the source material they�re based on? and (4) Are we really free to act and think as we choose, or is freedom merely an illusion? HUM; IC; Offered alternate years; B. Polite

PHIL 130 Ethics and Business

In this course we read, write and think about the nature of business and its relation to a good human life. We consider such questions as: Is anybody who provides a good to other people involved in a business? Could a society have businesses if it didn't also have money? In what sense does one have to do what one has contracted to do? Do businesses owe anything to those who create the conditions in which they flourish? Is there anything objectionable about asking as much as the market will bear for some product? HUM; Cross Listing: PJST 131; IC; D. Wack

PHIL 142 Philosophy as a Guide to Life

Cross Listing: ASIA 205;RELS 205; Normally offered alternate years; W. Young

PHIL 210 Ethics

Lying, murder and cheating at checkers are all species of injustice-what do they all have in common that makes them all injustices? Which is better, being just or appearing just? Must one care about being a just (or a good) person? It is easier to answer these questions than to explain why the right answers are right, although both tasks are challenging. We think about what the right answers are, and why they are right, through careful reading of some of the great moral philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, David Hume and Immanuel Kant. HUM; 8C; D. Wack

PHIL 211 Philosophy of Art

An exploration of the problems found in the analysis and criticism of the visual and performing arts.

Prerequisite(s): sophomore standing or permission of the instructor; IC; D. Wack

PHIL 212 Value and Exchange

How is value created and sustained? What role does exchange play in value's creation? In this course we explore the relation between value and exchange in order to analyze the contemporary, historical, and cross-cultural practices involving debt and money. We will read several theorists, including Georg Simmel, Karl Marx, Adam Smith, Marcel Mauss, David Graeber, and Gayle Rubin, on the relation between value and exchange. On this basis, we will then examine the ethical implications of money and debt relations. In so doing, we will analyze and contrast contemporary and market forms of exchange with historical and cross-cultural forms of exchange. Finally, we will develop these theoretical frameworks on value and exchante in order to better understand the most recent global crisis of value and exchange: the financial and market panic of 2008. IC; D. Wack

PHIL 218 Philosophy of Mind

This course examines the relationship between the mind and the natural world. Some of the topics the course may consider are: What is the relationship between the mind and the body? Given that cognitive processes are rule-bound processes, are these rules learned or innate? Do these rules permit objective knowledge, i.e., knowledge of the world as it is in and of itself? What explains the semantic content of cognitive states? What is consciousness? What is the status of computer intelligence? IC; B. Polite

PHIL 220 Contemporary Moral Theory

Contemporary moral philosophy is largely concerned with providing an objective basis for morals. A central challenge for contemporary moral philosophy is to show that morals are not entirely subjective, not entirely relative to a particular person's desires or beliefs or goals, and not even entirely relative to a particular culture's practices. This course examines the two most prevalent contemporary moral theories: Utilitarianism and Kantianism. We consider central contemporary discussions of subjectivism and relativism regarding morals and then read John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant, as well as several contemporary discussions of their doctrines. Prerequisite(s): one philosophy course or sophomore standing, or permission of the instructor; D. Wack

PHIL 228 Death and Life

In this course, we articulate the concepts of life and death by surveying a variety of ancient and modern philosophical accounts of them in order to see the role such an understanding of these concepts can play in helping us think about our relations to ourselves and to others. In exploring both ancient philosophical practices designed to cultivate ways of thinking about death and more modern attempts to grapple with these two concepts, we investigate the conceptual difficulties and rewards in thinking of death and life. IC; D. Wack

PHIL 230 Political Philosophy

This course is an historical introduction to political philosophy focusing especially on the ideas of liberalism and democracy. Our own form of government is (perhaps only ideally) a realization of both of these values and is an important source of their currency as ideals in much of the contemporary world. But what is liberalism? What is democracy? What forms can liberalism and democracy take? Are some forms preferable to others? What is so valuable about liberalism and democracy anyway? Can both be realized by a state? If there is a conflict, which value should take precedence? Offered alternate years. IC; Normally offered alternate years; D. Wack

PHIL 243 Philosophies of Feminism

This course explores the theoretical frameworks by which feminists explain the exploitation and oppression of women. The aim of this course is to understand how feminists conceive of sexism, how they model a nonsexist society, and the manner in which they believe this society may be established. We proceed historically, beginning with Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of A Woman, ending with contemporary feminist issues. Among the varieties of feminist thought covered are Enlightenment feminism, cultural feminism, Marxist feminism, psychoanalytic feminism, radical feminism and contemporary French feminism. HUM; Prerequisite(s): sophomore standing; Cross Listing: GWST 243; W. Young

PHIL 244 Philosophy of Music

This course considers the nature of music and its significance. Our central question will be: in what ways can music be meaningful? More specific questions may include: What is a musical work? What determines whether performances are authentic or good? Why do we sometimes find music to be not just enjoyable but also intensely moving and even profound? We approach these questions through a careful examination of key texts and arguments in musical aesthetics, and with respect to a variety of musical styles. No special knowledge of philosophy or music is presupposed for students entering the class. HUM; Cross Listing: MUS 244; IC; B. Polite

PHIL 246 Philosophy of Film

Popular movies characteristically depict actions, with a climactic action or event giving significance and structure to the earlier events in the movie. What are the implications of the centrality of action and action representation in movies for our understanding of film and of action? How do movies help us to understand the relation between a world and the actions that are possible in that world? How do the movies allow us to think about actions and the inner lives of the agents who carry them out? How have the kinds of actions shown in popular movies developed and changed? How does the representation of action on film shed light on the nature of time? Cross Listing: FILM 246; D. Wack

PHIL 247 Moral Life in Literature

Literature raises two different types of moral questions: those concerned with the moral parameters guiding the creative process and those dealing with the moral issues raised from within the literary work itself. This course examines both issues. Regarding the former, we ask: Must good literature be moral or can an accomplished work of art be immoral? If there are moral guidelines for the production of literature, what are they? Regarding the latter, we use literature to better understand particular moral issues. What, for example, can literature add to our understanding of friendship, courage, community and the pursuit of individuality? Cross Listing: ENG 247; IC; B. Polite

PHIL 278 Memory and Perception

How are our capacities for memory and sense perception related? In what ways do they depend on each other? In this course, we examine a number of different philosophical accounts of the relations between memory and perception in order to determine the nature of the interdependence of these capacities. In so doing, we will clarify for ourselves how mind and world are related and see why it is the case that our ability to perceive the world we live in is itself a phenomenon that is conditioned by historical developments. We will read texts by Henri Bergson, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Elizabeth Anscombe, Friedrich Nietzsche, Stanley Cavell, and others.

RELS 224 American Indian Religious Freedom

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.." ~The 1st amendment to the U.S. Constitution The first amendment of the U.S. constitution appears to guarantee that those living within the country's borders would not be forced to adopt any particular religion, nor would the government interfere with their right to practice whatever religion they chose. Yet the experience of American Indian communities since 1787 belies this promise. This class will explore the first amendment, federal Indian policy, and key court cases in the history of American Indian religious freedom, to examine the tension between concepts of race, citizenship, and free worship in the United States.
